# Encode Solidity Bootcamp
#### HW #4

## Scope

âœ“ Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate and query results on chain\
âœ“ Request voting tokens to be minted using the API\
âœ“ (bonus) Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display that on frontend\
ðŸš§ (bonus-work in progress) Use an oracle to fetch off-chain data\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use an oracle to fetch information from a data source of your preference\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the data fetched to create the proposals in the constructor of the ballot

Voting dApp integration guidelines

âœ“ Build the frontend using Scaffold ETH 2 as a base\
âœ“ Build the backend using NestJS to provide the Mint method\
âœ“ Implement a single POST method\
âœ“ Request voting tokens from API\
âœ“ Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot\
âœ“ All other interactions must be made directly on-chain

## Note

I have made some extra functionality to sign directly on-chain from user's wallet without storing private keys in the `.env` file.  

Make sure you have a .env file that includes your RPC endpoints and private key on the server side.
